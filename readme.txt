=== Plugin Name ===Contributors: jacobgspTags: options, settingsRequires at least: 3.0Tested up to: 3.3.1Stable tag: trunkQuickly create, manage and use custom options in your themes!== Description ==Allows you to create custom options that you can easily update via the `Options` administration panel and also allows you to use mentioned options in your theme using a simple PHP function:`get_custom_option ( $slug [, $default_value, $field ] )`By default, only Administrators can change Custom Options, however you can use the filter `gsp_custom_options_capability` to change that.
